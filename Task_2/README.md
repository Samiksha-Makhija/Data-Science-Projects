# Stock Market Prediction And Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

here used the Stacked LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). A Machine Learning Model for Stock Market Prediction. Stock market prediction is the act of trying to determine the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on a financial exchange.
The work mainly focuses on stock market prediction in the coming days. We use parameter tuning using LSTM where we lessen the RMSE value and error of our prediction.
